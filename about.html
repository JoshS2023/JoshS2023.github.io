This is about my life, my personal intrests and what i enjoy doing the most.I am currently a student that attends
<br> Bronx Early college academy, we graduate in 2024 and we leave earlier but we officially graduate in june because 
<br> because thats when we get our diploma.
<br><br>My daily routine consists of playing video games watching videos and etc, recently i have not been making videos
<br>because of summer vacation and i just wanted a break from the whole content creation thing for a bit so i can recollect
<br>and refresh my brain.Ive also taken a break my working out on a daily basis as well but recently ive started getting back
<br> into the swing of things and working out again, i also enjoy watching anime from time to time during my spare time.<img src="Artifacts/luffy-from-one-piece-goku-from-dragon-ball-z-and-saitama-from-one-punch-man.png" width="500" height="300" alt=""/>
